# ping-pong
The popular sport of table tennis or "ping-pong" made a pc game to practice frontend technologies and OOP. (PC version only)

This project was made from scratch based on the popular sport "Ping-Pong" for learning purposes only, as part of my own programming learning path. 

It helped me to keep practicing and strengthen my knwoledge with frontend technologies and concepts like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Canvas and Object Oriented Programming.
