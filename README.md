This project was built **from scratch** as part of my personal learning journey in software development.  
It's inspired by the classic *Ping Pong* game and helped me reinforce my knowledge of:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Canvas API
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In addition to the core gameplay, it includes:

- Main menu
- Sound effects
- Winning effects
- Keyboard-based controls

## 🎮 How to Play

2. Use the **keyboard** to control the game (movement, menu access, etc.).
3. For a full list of controls, and how-to play, open the **in-game menu** by pressing the **Spacebar**.
