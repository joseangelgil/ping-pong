## 🎯 Description

This project was built **from scratch** as part of my personal learning journey in software development.  
It's inspired by the classic *Ping Pong* game and helped me reinforce my knowledge of:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Canvas API
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In addition to the core gameplay, it includes:

- Main menu
- Sound effects
- Winning effects
- Keyboard-based controls

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Try to hit the ball past your opponent to score points.
2. Don’t let the ball reach your side of the table — defend your goal!
3. Be careful with your aim: if the ball goes out of bounds (above or below the table) **without touching the opponent's side**, your opponent scores a point.
4. The first player to reach **7–0**, or **11 points** with a **2-point lead**, wins the game!  
   If the time runs out, the player with at least a **2-point lead** wins.
5. Use the **keyboard** to control the game (movement, menu access, etc.).
6. For a full list of controls and gameplay details, open the **in-game menu** by pressing the **Spacebar**.

Challenge your friends and show them who's the best!
